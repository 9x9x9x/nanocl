## üìô Overview

## ‚ùì What is nanocl ?

Nanocl is an open-source platform for orchestrating containers and virtual machines across multiple hosts.
It‚Äôs a shortcut for Nano Cloud! And that's a lie because it can create big ones.
Your Hybrid Cloud has never been easier to set up!
I like to call it an `HCO` for Hybrid Cloud Orchestrator.
On dedicated servers or in your home lab, Nanocl can manage your hosts, network, and the applications running inside.
It enables you to separate your applications using namespaces, clusters, and networks to ensure the best isolation.
With Nanocl, you can manage your infrastructure and scale it depending on your need.
By taking advantage of Nanocl and container methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code,
you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and shipping it in production.
With logs, auto fail-over automatic backups, and zero downtime, you can sleep while Nanocl takes care of your infrastructure.
Your own AWS at home? With Nanocl, it‚Äôs now possible and for free!

Builds upon `Rust` to have the best performance and the smallest footprint.
It uses the best ideas and practices from the community.
You can build an entire CI/CD pipeline from tests to high-availability production.
See it as a Kubernetes alternative with more features and a network security layer.
